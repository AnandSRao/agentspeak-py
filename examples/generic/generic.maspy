/* 
In this system, two agents are inside a room and 
one agent (the claustrophobe) wants to maintain 
the door always unlocked, while another (the paranoid) 
wants to maintain it locked!

The porter is the agent that is capable to (un)lock 
the door (i.e., to act in the environment). So other 
agents should ask him such services.

A Prometheus specification is available in the doc folder.
